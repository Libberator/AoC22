### Template Features
- Uses Reflection to easily discover classes
- Supporting Data Structures:
    - Vector2Int and Vector3Int
	- Bounds and Bounds3D
	- Node and Grid for graph traveral or pathfinding
	- Circular Array
- Lots of Utility helpers:
	- Pathfinding (A* and Dijkstra)
	- Collection extensions
	- Math extensions (primes, factors, GCD, LCM, and more)
	- File reading helpers
- Perfect for test-driven development:
	- Uses strings so no need to convert between `int`, `long`, or use `dynamic`
	- Supports multi-line answers (\*only for Part 2). Tip: use StringBuilder
- Benchmark project to compare your solution against your friends

### Solutions
According to one of AoC's FAQs:
> every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

I used ten-year-old hardware, and all of my solutions *combined* can be ran in under 15 seconds.
